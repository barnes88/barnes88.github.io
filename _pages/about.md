I'm a PhD candidate at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering advised by [Professor Tim Rogers](https://engineering.purdue.edu/tgrogers/) within the [AALP](https://engineering.purdue.edu/tgrogers/group/aalp.html) research group. Currently I am an intern at [AMD Research](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research.html) where I am investigating microarchitectectural features to improve the performance of Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) construction algorithms used for ray tracing on the next generation of GPUs.


My research interests broadly span parallel processing architectures and improving the programmability of hardware accelerators.
Specifically, my work has studied the core architecture changes necessary to drive power and performance improvements across the increasingly diverse set of applications targeted for GPUs.

Previously I have worked on product teams at [Intel](https://www.intel.com), [Arm](https://www.arm.com/), and [Collins Aerospace](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/) doing performance characterization, pre-silicon verification, and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design.
