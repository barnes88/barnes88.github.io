I'm a Research Scientist at [Meta](https://about.meta.com/) on the [ML Systems HW/SW Codesign team](https://aisystemcodesign.github.io/), where I work on custom silicon systems like the [Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA)](https://ai.meta.com/blog/next-generation-meta-training-inference-accelerator-AI-MTIA/). I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) under the supervision of [Professor Tim Rogers](https://engineering.purdue.edu/tgrogers/) focusing on GPU microarchitecture.

My research interests broadly span parallel processing architectures and improving the programmability of hardware accelerators. My PhD thesis [*Improving the Utilization and Performance of Specialized GPU Cores*](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/IMPROVING_THE_UTILIZATION_AND_PERFORMANCE_OF_SPECIALIZED_GPU_CORES/28462811?file=52615397), studied the impact of core partitioning on warp-specialized workloads and explored expanding the utility of ray tracing hardware acceleration units beyond traditional graphics applications. I also have an ongoing interest in expanding and improving cycle-level architecture simulators like [Accel-Sim](https://accel-sim.github.io/) and [gem5](https://www.gem5.org/).

Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist Intern at Meta on the SoC Creations team in [Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), where I worked on performance models for AR/VR silicon. I have also worked as an intern at [AMD Research](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/research.html), where I investigated microarchitectectural features to improve the performance of Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) construction algorithms used for ray tracing on GPUs. Prior to that, I worked on product teams at [Intel](https://www.intel.com), [Arm](https://www.arm.com/), and [Collins Aerospace](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/) doing performance characterization, pre-silicon verification, and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design.
